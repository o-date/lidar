NB. The final codeblock in both notebooks creates an animated gif from the data. That final codeblock is computationally intensive; it will take some time to run. The results will be written to a new folder called 'export'; you can open that folder by clicking on the jupyter logo at top and then clicking on the 'export' folder.

You will know the code is finished when the `[*]` at the left of the code block changes to a number.

Start with the Montreal demo notebook. It contains some code that the Avebury notebook depends on.
